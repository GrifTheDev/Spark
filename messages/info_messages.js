With your suggestions and ideas we can make Student Zone a better place. So, here is a quick rundown of how it works.\n\nFirstly, you have to come up with a suggestion. You may be inspired by something that is missing in the sevrer, or maybe an original idea you just thought of. Whatever the case, please make sure your suggestions have some quality and thought put into them, as we don't accept **low effort suggestions**. It is also recommended that you **search for your suggestion before submiting it**, so that duplicate suggestions can be prevented.\n\nOnce you have your suggestion ready, you need to submit it using our suggestion system! Head on over to <#888064585561677854> and type **/suggestion create** to get started. Once you type the command, a menu should come up showing you the possible input options for that command. The only possible and required option is the suggestion itself, so go on and put your suggestion inside the *suggestion* field. Once done, all you have to do is press [Enter] a couple of times and the command will be executed! If all goes well you should see a message saying that your suggestion has been submited. Go over to <#888064625927675924> and check if your suggestion has appeared there! In the rare case it has not, DM <@909164542532157510> as soon as possible.\n\nNow, all you have to do is wait for the community to vote on the suggestion and for the staff team to review it. The suggestion can either be approved or denied. For every approved suggestion you get **0.5 rep**, unless you have never had an approved suggestion before, in which case you will get **3.5** rep.",
